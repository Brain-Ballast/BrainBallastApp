config-csv file path hardcoded for now
server.js main backend server file
routes- api endpoints 
-status shows file path, rows, cols, and some sample data when called
-download streams exact csv file for download on front endpoints
-reload, used to reload file data if file has changed or been updated
-records returns a sample of 10 rows worth of data
-series returns formated csv file for graphics on frontend.
lib-csv for csv reading and caching for now a in-memory cache holds the parsed results... I think we agreed no database so in the final version this would be reading from the output of the py program that outputs a seperate csv file for each run
